# Prototyping boards for STM32F103C8 Bluepill and STM32F411CE Blackpill

This repo contains the KiCad files for a prototyping board for both the STM32F103C8 Bluepill and STM32F411CE Blackpill boards.

These have been designed by a complete amateur with absolutly no knowledge of power supplies, and therefore these are a best effort design using recommended components and circuit designs for the power supply.
